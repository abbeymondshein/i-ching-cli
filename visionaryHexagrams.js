    judgement: `The air is ripe with imagination, inspiration and energy. The flying dragon is an ancient symbol of a dynamic, arousing force that bodes well for creative movement. If your goals are in alignment with the greater good, positive actions taken with good timing will meet with success. This is an excellent time to exercise leadership, because you can be strong now. But be forewarned: success turns to failure if strength turns to arrogance. 
        This first hexagram contains all yang lines and is one of the most auspicious readings in the Book of Changes. Whoever draws this hexagram is assured success if they follow the six stages of development starting with the bottom line. By being sensitive to conditions and doing things in the right order, one develops more influence. Time itself becomes the means to make real what has only been the potential before now.
        Believe in your dreams and persevere, and everything around you will flourish. Call upon Creative Power and let it work through you. Stay focused on your goals. Do not allow yourself to be distracted or you may lose the power that is available to you now. And remember that when taking action, success requires making the right moves at the right time.`
