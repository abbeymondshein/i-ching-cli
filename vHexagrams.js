    title: "27: Nourishment",
    meaning:
      "Nourishment refers to more than just a healthy diet of food. This hexagram represents the care-giving function. Eating properly implies care for oneself; providing healthy meals in the home is one way of caring for the family. The writer of a great book or composer of an inspiring piece of music also provides nourishment — to humanity in general — by caring deeply and offering the fruits of their works to the world.\nYou can know people by observing what they nourish in their own lives. Do they feed and take care of their bodies? Do they cultivate their spirits, their intellects, their moral values? Do they nourish and care for those around them? If so, to whom do they devote their energies? The most successful people are temperate in eating and drinking, thinking and dreaming. They strengthen the world by nurturing their higher self and sharing it with others.\nPay heed to your thoughts and impulses, ignoring those that undermine a healthy and persevering attitude. A wise person is temperate in the consumption of food and drink, because to be otherwise only leads to discomfort and disease. The fact that temporary pleasure may precede the discomfort does not influence a person of mature character. In the same way, be discriminating in your words and actions, lest a desire for temporary advantage lead you to cause pain for yourself or others. Enrich your character, and you will nourish everyone around you in the best way.\n",

    title: "43: Determination",
    meaning:
      "The persistence of negativity is a factor in human affairs; just when you think some major or minor evil has been uprooted, it will pop up again, sprouting through some crack in the pavement of decent society. Evil need not take extravagant forms, such as those exhibited in Nazi Germany. Garden-variety lies and deceit are more common and persistent, but should also be rooted out diligently. Be resolute against the forces of darkness — whether in your social or professional life or in your own soul. But certain rules must be followed for the effort to succeed.\nThe first rule: Do not compromise with corruption. Misdeeds and shameful actions must be identified for what they are, and quickly discredited. The second: You cannot successfully resist or defeat negativity on its own terms. Positive alternatives that lead away from the nature of the problem are more successful and appropriate than trying to counter corruption with raw power. The third rule: The means used to counter negativity needs to be consistent with the result you want to achieve. You cannot stop the spreading of lies by spreading more of them.\nBy adding to the positive elements in a situation, you automatically diminish the bad. This is the only way to tip the scales and effectively neutralize negativity over time. The reminder here is for you to maintain a consistent level of self-awareness while sharing your advantages and virtue with others.\n",

    title: "11: Harmony",
    meaning:
      "Earth seems to be above heaven and heaven is on earth. The gravity of matter merges with the upward radiation of light to merge in a condition of deep harmony. This juxtaposition denotes a time of peace and blessings for all living things. In the affairs of men, tranquility comes when the good, strong and powerful show favor to the lowly, and those of more modest means are well disposed toward those who are currently blessed. There is an end to all feuds. In such a state, energy is high, the way clear and the prospects for great success are outstanding.\nA deep chaos abides in nature, but man, by carefully responding to the rhythms and cycles of the times, can find peace in the natural world. By planting the right crop in the right place in the right season, the mindfulness of the farmer brings harmony into the natural world of plants, and prosperity to his family. Similarly, business needs to adjust to the natural cycles of different seasons; only through flexibility and constant adjusting can order and growth both be maintained. Peace produces a time of flowering and prosperity; the wise person channels this positive energy to all areas of life, to each in proper proportion, just as a farmer waters his fields and orchards. But be vigilant and discriminating: otherwise, peaceful conditions can promote the growth of weeds as well as flowers.\n",

    title: "49: Revolution",
    meaning:
      "The elements of this hexagram are fire under water. Fire evaporates water, and water puts out fire. Similarly, change often causes conflict, and conflict brings about change. This hexagram refers to a time in the cycle of human affairs when things are stirring up, and when the hint of dramatic change is in the air.\nIn order to succeed, a revolution must be in alignment with laws of nature and good timing. It must begin at the right moment, gather support from a broad base of people, be guided by sincere and capable leaders and — most important of all it must address a real need. The strength of the forces of change will always be in proportion to the urgency of the need being championed. This is true whether the revolution is in government, business, education, or in your own personal affairs.\nRevolutionary change is a period when chaos arises from order. Let’s remember that not all order is good, and not all chaos bad. Chaos is often an integral part of the way things evolve — as any parent and evolutionary science will confirm. This hexagram reminds us to have the courage to radically change and renew the way we bring ourselves to life. In this way, you can channel chaos to your cause and unleash a new power on behalf of the good. If engaging in a negotiation, change the rules; if composing a piece of music, add the unexpected; if courting a lover, dare to be unconventional.\nCombat between forces of dark and light are cyclical; one can become aware of these cycles and master them by preparing in advance. In periods of drought, even wild storms are preferable to just another sunny day. A new season awaits.\n",

    title: "18: Repairing the Damage",
    meaning:
      "When something is rotting, it is time to repair the damage. In the world of human affairs, self-indulgence and corruption grow like weeds in an untended garden. They must be faced squarely and rooted out through bold action. Eliminating corruption — and the sloppiness that leads to it — is an ennobling human enterprise, as it clears the way for fresh, new beginnings. Such repair efforts ultimately lead to supreme success.\nThis is a time to be lean and efficient. The weeds must be rooted out before the whole garden is lost. Fighting decay, indifference and corruption is not a simple matter; the steps must be evaluated carefully, and planning should precede action. Resist the temptation to strike out prematurely. Gather strength around you, and marshal your inner resources, because arresting decay requires a strong effort. When you do act, pay close attention to the process. Make your strike as precise and clear as the path of the surgeon’s knife.\n",

    title: "40: Deliverance",
    meaning:
      "A feeling of clarity and fresh opportunity follows a thunderstorm, or any time of extreme tension or obstacles. The storm has had the effect of clearing the air and suddenly reducing atmospheric tension. This symbolizes that some kind of deliverance is at hand. In the wake of a storm on land, deliverance can appear in the form of new color and life, which bursts forth in fields and flowers. Following a storm at sea, deliverance could take the form of land itself.\nIn the realm of human relations, the rain of forgiveness can wash the human landscape clean after a conflicted period of enmity and error. Great clarity of purpose and renewed vigor can follow the healing of old wounds. But care must be taken not to accidentally reopen these old wounds by moving too quickly. Similarly, it is important to return to normalcy before moving ahead with new plans or projects after periods of stress.\nFollowing the resolution of a difficult situation, your first priority is to return to normal conditions as quickly as possible. Breathe a sigh of relief, but don’t relax completely. It would be a mistake to reawaken the sleeping dogs of the immediate past before the new situation has stabilized. Look ahead. Attend to residual matters that need taking care of, and do so as quickly as possible. Make a clean sweep of the past and move deliberately. Forgive, forget, move on, and your fortunes will improve.\n",

    meaning:
      "A gentle wind gathers clouds, but still there is no rain. Softer influences predominate as the power of the “small” accumulates, making this a time for smooth and friendly persuasion.\nThe ebb and flow of events are like waves in the sea — there are periods of low tide. This is a time when more sweeping actions are impossible or inappropriate, but when small matters that will lead to bigger and better things later on can be attended to with success. When the tide is rolling in, by all means ride the waves, but when it is receding like it is now, focus on the little things.\nWhen you cannot do much to affect large matters, persuasion and subtle influence prepare the way for stronger moves in the future. Use your intuition to chart your long-term course, but avoid bold actions for now; they are unlikely to work. This is a better time to refine existing abilities or develop new talents.\nGentleness is the keyword here. Regarding whatever is on your mind right now, gentleness combined with determination is likely to generate more progress than brute force ever could.\n",

    title: "6: Conflict",
    meaning:
      "Conflict often arises when a person who is convinced that he or she is entitled to something meets with opposition. In such cases, the wise choice is not to push things to the bitter end, because knocking heads perpetuates ill will. Creative solutions that meet others halfway are more valuable and longer lasting than victories achieved through force.\nConflicts in which one party is not sincere inevitably lead to subterfuge and distortions. In such situations, those of strong character keep a clear head, protect their integrity, and look out for their own interests, even while seeking compromise. It can help to find a fair-minded mediator who can settle matters.\nIn these times of conflict and turmoil, new ventures and new initiatives should be avoided.\nThis is a good time to examine the sincerity of your current beliefs and the beliefs of those around you. Seek advice or arbitration from an impartial and mature person. Consider everything carefully before making any major decisions. This may be a time to compromise. Clarify the roles and responsibilities of those you live and work with to reduce conflict in the future.\n",

    title: "29: Dangerous Depths",
    meaning:
      "Exposure to danger brings good fortune to those who move beyond it. Like boaters staying afloat through white-water rapids, those faced with serious challenges need to remain alert. They must take all available precautions and, above all, keep going forward so as to remove themselves from harm’s way. Once the danger has passed, everything is good.\nThe positive side of danger is that it offers an excellent chance to cleanse the senses and strengthen the spirit. Surviving a crisis can be tremendously reinvigorating, sharpening the eye and the mind for future challenges.\nIt is reckless to court danger, but critical for inner development not to shrink from it either. Those who respond to dangerous conditions most effectively are those who can establish an inner bubble of calm in the midst of chaos. An emotionally stable center keeps one rooted in the moment, alert and focused. Courage at times like this springs from focused attention and a brave willingness to penetrate the moment of peril to its very core, so as to reshape it and transform it.\n",

    title: "10: Treading Carefully",
    meaning:
      "Competent people find their way and make progress, even in difficult circumstances. Consider your steps carefully when powerful forces surround you. The weak and strong can coexist when the weaker element does not impose upon the stronger one, when the weaker maintains good humor and avoids taking bold action. When treading among sleeping tigers — or slippery stones — step gingerly, and don’t stumble.\nAt this time, a relatively humble force or person is having influence over a stronger one, and for this reason, must be particularly careful. In the company of brash people, rushing wildly ahead will only bring misfortune. Now is not a good time for taking initiative. Rather, try getting by with a little grace and good humor. In the court of a powerful king, the jester often has more power than a prince.\n",

    meaning:
      "Ambitious undertakings are not in order, but attention to small matters brings decent progress. Such is the case for a person whose resources are meager, but who, through modesty and perseverance, eventually rises to accomplish great things.\nAn early key to success is to avoid pretentious ambitions and grandiose goals. The power of the small is served by slow and steady advancement, and succeeds through an honest acceptance of its own limitations, without reservation.\nModesty stemming from recognizing limitations is a fine quality, but it can be seen as weakness if it is not accompanied by conscientiousness and dignity. It is very important, therefore, to understand the demands of your situation, and not to expect success in big things right now. The wise person recognizes and accepts the nature of the time. Know your role, attend to details and act with humility. You can achieve success, even with few resources.\n",

    title: "60: Limits and Connections",
    meaning:
      "Limits are necessary to channel energy, guide purpose and lend direction to life. Constantly swimming in a sea of boundless opportunity leads to exhaustion. Winging it alone wild and free in a sky of unlimited directions and opportunities only leads to becoming lost. In human affairs, the making of decisions and alliances necessarily implies limitation, for in choosing one path, another must be left behind.\nA key to a successful life is to select your limits consciously and carefully — to be discriminating in the setting of personal boundaries, but also knowing when to fly in formation. Just as thrift often precedes prosperity, letting go of selfish interests leads to greater personal reward. Only by consciously accepting useful limits can your energy be channeled to good purpose, and lead to lasting accomplishment.\nAim for a middle way between discipline and freedom of spirit. Limits will come of their own accord; but to consciously make good decisions and select compatible affiliations… now, that’s knowing how to fly! On the other hand, do not go overboard on discipline. Even limitation must be limited, so that in the effort to bring order and direction into your life, you do not choke off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity.\nIn groups and organizations, rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too lenient. If they are too difficult to live with, laws build frustration among people, and ultimately become destructive. If the rules are too soft, then sloppiness becomes acceptable and energy is soon dissipated. The best path is one that allows for the unfolding of individual potential, while encouraging some self-discipline and focus along the way.\n",

    meaning:
      "Throughout all the cultures of the world, the well has served as a symbol for that which sustains life and provides a constant, inexhaustible source of nourishment.\nLike the well, human nature is basically the same around the world. The passage of time cannot add to its dimensions, nor take anything away. Still, just as the well can be deepened to produce clearer water, we can enrich our lives by delving deeply within, to tap our essential nature and reach the true source of spiritual nourishment.\nBeware of shallow thinking. Like a little learning, it can be dangerous. The image of the well suggests that going further within produces greater clarity. Be patient, and penetrate your problems — and your own nature — as deeply as you can. Self-development is key to reaching down to tap the clear water. If you do not lower your bucket into the depths, you’re likely to come up empty. Remember: When greater depth is sought, lessening the speed of normal operations may be required. A shallow carelessness in the process of meeting needs can be self-defeating or even dangerous.\n",

    title: "51: Shock",
    meaning:
      "One hears thunder unexpectedly. First comes fear, then a sharpened vision. Recall a close brush with danger — a falling branch, an automobile accident barely avoided, an escape from a violent confrontation. Such incidents arouse every nerve in your body — perhaps in a brief wave of panic — but soon, once the danger has passed, the initial reaction gives way to a heightened awareness. The same process occurs with other types of shock — the loss of a job, the death of a loved one, business failure and so on.\nThe lasting impact of a major shock can be stimulating or debilitating, depending upon your strength of character. The critical factor is the ability to make yourself immune to fear, enabling you to transform anxiety into laser-sharp perception. There is a positive side to such shock.\nWhen overtaken by crisis, the wise look within and search their hearts for strengths, in order to face the world with courage. Courage can mean daring to take the unexpected path, to bounce back quickly after failure, or to have faith in the meaning of life when confronted with great loss, even death.\nWe tend to think of shock only in terms of unpleasant events. We can also be jarred, however, by the release of tension that comes with an unexpected success. To keep your bearings in the aftershock of either trauma or victory, it is essential that your inner compass be aligned with that magnetic force that guides you toward fulfillment of your deepest desires and your highest destiny. So prepare yourself to take some jarring surprise in stride. Meditate a little bit to center yourself. A calm reaction — to either gains or losses that may arise — will help you surmount the shocks to your system.\n",

Those who would be loved must become the imagined lover of their beloved. Those who would prosper must bend with the pressures of the world. In matters of principle, stand firm; in matters of style and taste, swim with the current. If guile or self-aggrandizement enters the equation, resistance will be what follows. Focus on the common good in order to remain unharmed.\nIn the affairs of humanity, change is constant and old ideas are discarded in favor of new ones. A great leader can emerge only by being adaptable to the demands of the times. Similarly, only by adjusting to changing circumstances can one prosper in the world of commerce. Remain flexible, and you will gain the confidence of those around you. Bend and you shall not break.\nBalance activity with some relaxation to be able to serve the situation well and to help maintain a state of healthy energy, minimizing both internal and external resistance to your goals.\n",

      "A subtle penetrating effect is like a soft wind blowing through some reeds that are bending gracefully, demonstrating flexibility and endurance. This symbolizes a quiet, relaxed effectiveness in action. This is a gentle influence that is at work, but just as the wind can be ceaseless in its efforts, small forces can add up to produce lasting results.\nGentle penetration bodes well for new relationships or enterprises. Just as a summer breeze slowly penetrates the woods to cool the forest, the ideas of gifted leaders slowly reach the minds and sink into the hearts of people. In personal relationships, a gentle beginning can lead to a long-lasting union.\nWhen using a force that is gentle but persistent, careful aim is necessary, for only when a small force continually moves in the same direction will it have a cumulative effect. In human affairs, this kind of soft influence comes more through strength of character than by direct confrontation or active seduction. It’s important to have, and stick to, clearly defined goals now. Maintaining a strong vision and following a steady course of least resistance will bring good fortune.\n",

Learning to act when it is time to act, and how to be still when it is wise to keep still, is the key to obtaining the peace of mind that helps you stay focused when a clear focus is needed.\nConsider the spine, which serves as a switchboard for all the nerves of the body that mediate movement. When the spine is kept flexible and healthy through proper rest and relaxation, active movement can be undertaken without strain. When the spine is held erect in a balanced sitting posture, the inner balancing of meditation can take place.\nTreat your vitality as if it were a candle in the wind — protecting it as though it were the only light in a dark forest on a moonless night. Avoid external conditions that threaten to snuff out this precious flame, and be careful not to suffocate it with your ambitions or worries.\nTime out. Relax, take your shoes off, and sit a spell.

    meaning:
      "A splashy sunset bathes the mountains in a soft radiance; the light of a full moon dances on the surface of a rippling river. Grace and beauty adorn the natural world. Grace is neither an all-powerful force, nor is it the essential or fundamental thing. By itself, it is form without content. Grace is moonlight on water, not the sunlight at noon. Yet grace brings artistic expression into the world, and enhances the quality of our lives. Grace brings success in small matters.\nIn the arts, grace arises out of adherence to form: the dancer becoming the choreography of the dance; the musician giving life to a musical score; the painter becoming one with brush and canvas. In human affairs, grace is aligned with mastery of aesthetic and cultural forms honed by time and honored by tradition. Through appreciation of graceful forms in human culture, we apprehend the pure beauty of the ideal, of life raised above the struggle for survival.\nPossession of grace, like the bearing of a beautiful gift to a wedding, can add stature to those in humble positions. Take care to lend grace and dignity to small matters, while giving the weight of deep and careful consideration to matters of greater consequence. Though it should not be confused with true substance, artistic flair can take one far in this world.\n",

    title: "2: Receptive Power",
    meaning:
      "Great receptivity attracts gifts and great blessings. A natural responsiveness attracts success through support and perseverance, rather than through bold action. Thus, a wise person demonstrates strength like a powerful but gentle mare. This auspicious hexagram, consisting of all yin lines, represents the power of the feminine principle that has not been honored in our modern world, but such receptivity is much more powerful and healing than we think.\nThe receptive force is sensual and subtle and can be overlooked by too much thinking, talking and planning. When spring comes, does the grass “plan” to grow? This is a time to concentrate on realities rather than potentials — with how to respond to a situation rather than how to direct or manipulate it. The mature feminine allows herself to be guided by a higher power and is skilled at graceful acceptance. In a strong spiritual way, her quiet contribution is effective and brings a deep experience of success.\nDo not be too assertive at this time. If you try to direct things now, you are liable to become confused or alienated. Opening yourself to receive what you attract should be your primary concern. Be patient. Take your time. Draw strength from carefulness and you will be doubly fortunate. Focus more on feeling than on action. Be broad and deep in your attitude so that you accept everything that comes with grace and equanimity. Be receptive and spacious like the ocean; let the river of changes flow to you. You might allow a partner to take the lead for now. Strive for a natural responsiveness that is based on inner strength rather than outer show. You will be able to go further by letting go of control, rather than forging ahead under your own steam. Receptive power arises through alignment with the Creative, not in opposition to it.\n",

    title: "45: Gathering Together",
    meaning:
      "The power of gathering together is represented by a rally, where each individual’s strength is magnified by the collective power of a community. For instance, history has shown that mass movements can bring about stable, ordered and durable conditions for the better. This reading may be pointing to an auspicious time for large group events or undertakings. The guiding force of a shared vision is essential to align unified forces and keep your people advancing toward a common goal.\nAnother image is that of a lake or basin filling with water. Just as the fullness of the lake can bring good fortune to all in its realm, it can also overflow, leading to disaster. In a time of gathering together, it is essential that precautions against unforeseen dangers be considered, along with efforts to advance the common good along a clearly charted course. Much of human misfortune comes from unexpected events for which we are ill prepared. When gathered together with others, we are more powerful — even if, in some ways, we are also more vulnerable.\nAny time of gathering together is a time of potentially great power, which can be either positive or negative. Everything is magnified when masses of people join together for a single purpose. When many people unite behind a single goal or strong vision, it is wise to take personal precautions, and to protect your reasonable self-interests, because these can easily be lost in the melee of the crowd.\n",

The power of enthusiasm is best symbolized by music and dance. It is guided more by the heart than the head. Great good fortune can follow when an enthusiastic leader is a person of strong character, one who is able to guide this positive energy toward a favorable destination.\nEnthusiasm, in a personal relationship or in a group, generates special electricity. For instance, when the crowd at a music festival is charged up, the singers scale new heights, and life becomes its own reward. And who is not in awe of thunder? Who would fail to fill his or her lungs with refreshing air in the aftermath of a cleansing rain?\nArouse the passionate support of others, while adjusting your ideas and plans to suit their needs.

      "Humility is rewarded in human affairs, just as valleys are ultimately filled by the erosion of great mountains. It is the way of the universe to fill the empty cup and to empty the full cup. Regardless of your position in human society, humility is a deceptively powerful attribute. If you are in a high position but remain humble, people will be drawn to you and causes that you espouse. If your position is lowly, humility will endear you to those of higher status. True humility is a virtue that benefits all and to which all should aspire.\nThe most successful people are those who know how to bring situations into balance by reducing those that are too great, and adding to those that are too small. Such a person strives for balanced and stable relationships, not power over others. Humility is the virtue that allows you to perceive the balancing potential in every situation. Humble people are not prey to the illusions that spring from self-importance. If humility is difficult for you, make a conscious effort to develop a bit of self-effacing humor.\n",

    meaning:
      "The situation calls for confronting a thorny situation and cutting through it. Somehow, the way to harmony and unity is blocked or frustrated — perhaps by a tangle of deceit or corruption. Like Alexander the Great cutting the Gordian knot, take decisive action and you will meet with good fortune. Don’t be afraid to shake things up a bit. The ability to take corrective measures, when they are needed, is an essential trait of leadership.\nThose who bring discipline to bear must, above all, be honest — with others, and with themselves. Honesty is the hallmark of the strong and self-confident. The successful person masters the art of honesty like the swordsman masters fencing. When lies, delusions and game playing are getting in the way of teamwork, the swift sword of honest action, perhaps even punishment, must be wielded to protect integrity and values. Decisiveness with integrity will bring good fortune.\nThough your actions be vigorous, they must not be hasty, severe or arbitrary. Be sure to carefully consider all the circumstances. In the case of a serious disruption of relations or events, forgive, but don’t forget — at least not until a person has made reparation for his mistakes. If corrective action is necessary, make certain that it truly fits the crime. When rules have become slack and useless, only through the institution of clear and swift penalties can their effectiveness be restored.\nIn those situations where serious issues of justice are at stake, keep careful records, and do not hesitate to go public with the truth.\n",

    title: "64: Nearing Completion",
    meaning:
      "The situation is incomplete, but the chaos of the past is giving way to order, and the goal is in sight. Nevertheless, you are still treading on thin ice. The way ahead is unobstructed, the goal is clear, but a cautious and careful attitude is still important, lest you slip and fall.\nNearing Completion is the last hexagram of the I Ching. It suggests that the ever-spinning wheel of life never reaches a final conclusion. Just as a hidden sadness resides in the heart of true euphoria, just as the seeds of great achievement can sprout in a caldron of adversity, so too no end is ever really complete without a new beginning stirring inside it. Though we divide life into categories in order to understand and manage it, experience itself is seamless. With this reading, the Tao’s sixty-four-spoked, timeless wheel of change is ready to spin onward, ever evolving, ever staying the same.\nThe situation represented by this reading can be compared to taking a lengthy trek over a high mountain. At some point before reaching the peak, you can see in detail exactly how much farther you have to travel. You will have a good idea what it will take to reach the top, because of the climbing experience you’ve accumulated thus far. However, when you do reach the peak, which has been in sight for quite a long period of sustained effort, you will have done only that. You will have reached the top — achieving your initial goal — but now you must still descend the other side. This last critical segment is what remains before completion.\nYou may have little information and no experience of what it’s like descending the other side of the mountain. All your attention has been focused on the path going up. The coming situation may seem very strange to you, unlike anything that you have experienced before. The other side of the mountain is where the true mysteries reside. Proceed carefully, cautiously, and alertly — and you will arrive at the completion of your goal.\n",

    meaning:
      "A fisherman can cast the line, but still can only wait for the fish to bite. Your catch will come in its own good time; you cannot make it come sooner — neither by working nor by planning nor by wishing. You may have a need to provide nourishment, but only through patience can you become the bridge between the fickle fish and the eventual feast. Strength in a time of trial waits quietly, resolutely. Weakness grows agitated, and abandons the effort before the fish start biting. Periods of waiting are most fruitful when used for quiet contemplation. This is patience.\nProceed cautiously, but resolutely, with whatever you are doing. The situation calls for consistency and perseverance. Waiting is an essential skill; patience is a powerful force. Time is an ally for those with inner strength — the strength that allows you to be uncompromisingly honest with yourself, while sticking to the path you have charted. If you persevere with a positive attitude, time weakens even the hardest obstacles. To rush anything, or force results, stimulates resistance and causes setbacks. At best, you achieve surface changes that may just as quickly be reversed. Steadfast waiting — holding to your integrity — leads to slow but permanent improvements. In the end, you accomplish something great. Be content to practice patience.\n",

    meaning:
      "Something is about to collapse. A great pressure is causing an imbalance that needs correction. But if the dam is about to burst, moving out of the way is your first priority! Likewise, if you are in an old mine shaft and feel the earth begin to tremble, it is a time for quick, instinctive action and nimble footwork. At such a time, only extraordinary measures can produce a successful outcome. When the roof is collapsing, run first. Choose your destination later.\nExtraordinary times bring out the best and worst in people. Natural disasters produce stories of heroism, but also of looting and rioting. When a great weight is upon your world, powerful moments present opportunities to make great gains, because everything is in a state of flux. One can either move in the direction of positive change and improvement or toward stagnation. To achieve the former, one must go gently to the heart of the issue, to the cause. Then a smooth transition is assured.\nThis may be the moment you have been waiting for. Although the current challenge may seem to be more than you can handle, remember that a flood reaches its high-water mark for only a few brief moments, before it begins to subside. Action must be taken now to ensure opportunities for success later on. You never know the true extent of your abilities until you, at least once in your life, dive into a crisis with complete abandon, dedicating every ounce of your energy, every fiber of your being, to the cause at hand. Now is that time. Dare to win.\n",

    title: "63: After Completion",
    meaning:
      "It is a fine irony that after the completion of a project or great enterprise, there is still much to do. Completion is merely a pause in the cycle of creation and decay, a momentary still point for the swinging pendulum of life. Though completion implies a period of restful pause — and one that has been well earned — it is not an actual ending, but a harmonious flat spot in the constancy of change and movement, like the still point between the inhalation and exhalation of one’s breath.\nOne image of After Completion is that of a kettle of water boiling over a fire. When the forces are balanced, the water boils properly; but if the pot is too full and boils over, it puts out the fire. On the other hand, if the fire is too hot for too long, it can evaporate all the water. In maintaining the equilibrium that follows the completion of an arduous task, forces at work in the situation must be monitored carefully to ensure that a proper balance is maintained. The state of After Completion is a time for fine-tuning, for refinements and embellishments of what has been accomplished.\nEven as we enjoy a rewarding situation, the laws of the natural world dictate that influence and success must eventually decline. Don’t let current good fortune give rise to adopting an attitude that is too careless or relaxed. Whatever is successful or already established needs to be carefully maintained, without trying to expand it now. What is incomplete, on the other hand, should be brought to fruition without delay. Take satisfaction upon completion, enjoy a sense of fulfillment, but do not linger too long on endings.\n",

Each new day is launched on a fresh landscape, one that reaches out to grab our attention. Travel is a great teacher, and a great equalizer. There is an art to living on the road. Increased caution and discernment become the keys not only to success, but also to survival.\nIf you are entering a new environment, be sincere, flexible, and undemanding, rather than stubborn. Get rid of attitudes and habits that could encumber you, or make you too conspicuous. The onset of a great journey is not a favorable time to enter into binding agreements or to start new enterprises. And, though being the wanderer offers you a certain freedom from being judged by your history; you also have no history to fortify you. Pay close attention to local customs, and honor them.\n",

      "Increase and decrease are both part of the natural cycle of life. As another ancient scripture put it, “To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.” Like a reservoir used to irrigate the fields, learning to accept a temporary decrease — in position, feelings or material possessions — prepares the way for an increase in the future.\nWe live in materialistic times, but there is no disgrace in letting go of some of your assets; this can be part of an investment in future gain — a gain that may come in the form of greater freedom, learning or development of personal character. Likewise, the inner strength that comes from bearing an unanticipated loss can be balanced by an increase in inner strength and insight. When letting go of material desires leads to greater simplicity in daily life, good fortune comes calling.\nIn nature, the lake evaporates to form clouds that drop rain, which nurtures the surrounding forest. As the forest grows thick, more rain is captured to increase the lake. Similarly, some evaporation of resources or a decrease in one area of your life, will give rise to an eventual increase in another. A loss of responsibility at work can mean more free time, and more free time may generate greater creativity or other career options. In general, a decrease can free the spirit and fill the soul.\nBe mindful of the lesson of young lovers: even with minimal possessions, feelings of the heart can bring an unsurpassed richness to their lives. The smallest of actions, if sincere, can have great value. Remain confident, for a time of decrease may actually bode good fortune for you — especially if you remain open to the possibility.\nLet go of frustration, resistance and regret over whatever might be decreasing at this time. See the larger picture and accept the cycle.\n",

This points to a time when a strong force comes into its own and asserts its power.\nWhen a leader comes into a position of power, his or her personal strength usually may have already peaked. Great stamina has been required in climbing to the top of the mountain, but once at the summit, the support of others is needed to maintain position. Therefore, a shift in attitude becomes necessary to persevere in what is right and just. Let your strength be tempered by wisdom. To maintain power, the strong leader learns to share it with others. Only then will his position be secure, for he will not only be the possessor of power, but a source of it as well.\nIf you find yourself in a strong position, it is important to act responsibly and react with care. Power must not be allowed to degenerate into raw force that rides roughshod over everything in its path. A strong sense of responsibility to the collective good is the key to the successful exercise of power.

A common example is between a wife and a husband whose shared authority is critical. In fact, strong and harmonious kinship is dependent upon every member of the family or tribe. Trust, shared responsibilities, and good communication are primary values. Each person must be encouraged to find his or her position and appropriate contribution.\nA harmonious family is a team that symbolizes the ideal of human interdependence, and has long provided a foundation for society. The healthy family is an embryo of community and the native soil in which ethical values take root and grow. Fertilize this soil, and the entire society benefits.\nThe forces that bind a family are a balance of feminine and masculine — the nurturing and receptive combined with outgoing leadership and taking responsibility. In other words, good parenting. A parent’s words should be consistent, have meaning and power. Siblings’ relationships between themselves and their parents carry variations of feminine and masculine energies too. Relations on all kinds of teams are improved through cultivation of a yin/yang, open/responsible balance.

    meaning:
      "The attraction of opposites is a powerful and fundamental force. The image of this reading is that of a mutual attraction in the beginning stages. In response to the magnetic attraction between two people, the masculine principle (the creative, outgoing) seizes the initiative and then submits to the feminine (the receptive, nourishing). When the assertive is able to defer to the receptive, and when the receptive accepts responsibility and exercises its quiet leadership, an electric and profitable union is the result. This brings good fortune, for all success depends upon the effects of mutual attraction in some form or another.\nConsistency is important in matters of mutual attraction, for this is what separates courtship from mere seduction.\nIf you are by nature an initiator, it is good to make the first move. But you must remain sensitive, and highly principled and avoid the temptation to be at all manipulative. Let the power of mutual attraction just pull you along. If you are the receptive one, keep your mind innocent and free of pride, so that you may remain open to good advice or helpful assistance. When your influence arises from innocence, a powerful magnetic force is at work for you.\nEither way, remaining open to the forces of attraction brings good fortune. On the other hand, closing yourself off to them shuts down the soul. Learn to yield to the tugs and pulls of the heart.\n",

      "Some level of estrangement is indicated. For example, when brothers and sisters marry, they grow apart, since their allegiances lie with new families. Though they will remain close enough to deal with problems and share minor interests, they will be unable to undertake great projects together. Simply put, when people grow apart — even for the most natural of reasons — their points of view, values and interests diverge.\nDifferent natures and interests bring opposition into the world of human affairs. If opposition drifts into alienation and enmity, there are no good results. But when opposition takes the form of healthy competition, or when it is just part of the natural order of things and is recognized as such, good fortune is still possible for the relationship.\nWhen diverging interests make a situation seem stagnant or futile, remember that there are always creative possibilities inherent in polarities. One is reminded of the interplay of the opposites, yin and yang, that is fundamental to life itself. And, as the symbol of the Tao illustrates, the yin and the yang each have the seed of the other residing within them.\nWhen opposition has its roots in issues of principle, hold to your integrity and individuality.

When society is functioning properly, such people are supported and encouraged to contribute to their best abilities. A fresh approach to old habits is indicated. Look for ways of putting new life into old forms. Only when great vitality is present, can real breakthroughs be achieved.\n",

    title: "24: Returning",
    meaning:
      "A turning point recharges you and eventually brings success. This hexagram is associated with the turning of darkness back toward the light — the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, the day when darkness begins to decrease and the hours of daylight start to increase. This is the cusp of a turnaround — a time for letting go of the old and making way for the new; a time of new beginnings. And it all starts with rest.\nDon’t move too fast. A new momentum is just beginning. A turnaround requires that your energy be recharged by adequate rest, so that your life force is not depleted prematurely. This principle of hibernation, of allowing energy to renew itself and be strengthened by rest, applies to many situations: recuperation after an illness; the slow return of trust after a period of estrangement; the careful development of new relationships after the splitting apart of old ones.\n",

    title: "44: Liaison",
    meaning:
      "An attraction is strong, but the relationship may not be destined to last long. A coming together of disparate forces may not be what it seems. An apparently harmless — but potentially dangerous — element has attracted attention and is pulling on a stronger one. One image is of a bold but immature young girl who uses her charms to gain influence with a powerful man. The man dallies with her, thinking that it can do him no harm. Ha, famous last thoughts! When power shifts into the hands of those who are not prepared for it, harm can come to all parties. Still, you need not fear meetings with those whose positions are different from your own, as long as you are free of ulterior motives.\nBe wary of temptations that arise because of the power of your position or, conversely, your connection to someone in an important position. Generally, it is best to combat temptations to take advantage of power differentials by nipping them in the bud before they can flower. As soon as you become aware of a dangerous liaison, it usually behooves you to promptly speak up. Also know that there are times when a rendezvous of the yielding and the strong turns out to be a great opportunity for a positive and constructive relationship. The difference between careless connection and a relationship of depth lies in the motives of one’s heart. How sincere are you?\n",

    title: "33: Retreat",
    meaning:
      "All worthy goals meet some resistance. When negative forces predominate, a well-timed retreat can be a good move — in order to keep your energy up and allow you to persevere.\nStrategic retreat is not to be confused with escape or surrender. Nevertheless, a well-timed retreat can require quick and nimble movement, in order to take up a new position before you are damaged by a current threat. You are not admitting defeat by such action, but increasing your options and preserving your energy and other resources. Sometimes it is necessary to slow down, let go or move back in order to better position yourself for future moves, or to draw an opponent closer. Timing is critical, as is positioning and considerations of personal security. Skillful retreat is truly a sign of intelligence and strength.\nPeriods of withdrawal or retreat call for cool-headedness, so keep your wits about you. Attend to details while allowing for enough time to contemplate the big picture. Be creative. Remember, not all progress follows a straight line. Maintaining a sense of self-confidence is essential; small setbacks can easily become defeats if we’re mired in self-doubt or self-pity. A confident retreat can produce success.\nWaves of progress are short-lived. Strive to attune yourself to the up-and-down cycles of life. If you want something, allow it to come to you. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that you can “fix” any situation whenever you feel like it. Some things are bigger than you. Hold your pride in check, and you will be better prepared to discover creative openings when they arise.\n",

    meaning:
      "Flames hang on to their fuel in order to keep the fire burning. Likewise, in the human world, everything that radiates light or love is dependent upon something else. Through the webs of our interdependence, we see that everything is related, each thing to the other. Awareness of your attachment to other people is the key that opens the door to knowing your true place in the world. No human is an island.\nFire is also a symbol of liberation — crackling molecules that fly away from home. Paradoxically, by clinging to what is natural and appropriate, we gain inner freedom.\nGiven perseverance on your part, this reading indicates success. In spite of challenges, cling to what is luminous in yourself, in others, and in life itself, never forgetting your positive attachment to the highest good. When events seem foreboding, or people seem oppressive, remember the good that has been and is yet to be. Holding to this idea is to cling to the power of light, the only force that can illuminate darkness.\n",

During normal times, daily ritual and habit help keep life ordered and serene; but in times of exceptional opportunity, the force of a powerful personality is required.

This is an excellent time to nurture creativity by collecting and organizing your best ideas and plans. Now, even great and difficult undertakings can be successful.\nA hidden source of power for those who would do noble deeds is the study of the past.

    meaning:
      "Be on guard for the careless or rebellious attitudes characteristic of inexperience. Just as a youth requires instruction, this is a good time to focus on learning lessons from a patient teacher or life experience. Is there a circumstance in your life that you have failed to comprehend, perhaps because you didn’t appreciate its inherent complexities? Be respectful of anything or anyone who has something to teach you right now. If you are focusing on a relationship, ask yourself which of you is the student and which of you is the sage right now. If you are a parent, ask yourself: Who is being the teacher — you or your child?\nIn order to be ready for challenging times, let education be an ongoing part of your life. Develop the strong mind and will necessary to carry you through confusing times. The wise realize that experience, especially difficult experience, is a most powerful teacher. But we cannot be forced to learn, even from experience. Be the humble student who delights in learning, the one who nourishes an expanding awareness.\nExamine your attitude for factors that would limit your openness. Observe how you deal with the mistakes of others. Let people live their own lives and learn their own lessons. You may offer them your wisdom or advice, but do so only if they are receptive. Otherwise, give up trying to convince others that you are right — which is exhausting and counter-productive. If people are not receptive, let them proceed, even into difficult or dangerous circumstances. It may be the only way they can learn and, without learning, no one can achieve success. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t care, but trying to take care of someone else can sometimes actually be harmful. Live and let learn.\n",

    meaning:
      "Centering in truth is becoming conscious of the relationship between your heart and the circumstances of your life. This requires connecting with the fundamental wisdom that is within you, other people, and all of nature.\nTruth becomes power when you let go of prejudice and make yourself receptive to the world as it really is. This inner transformation can produce a remarkable influence, but it is quite rare. It is achieved only by those who cultivate genuine openness to the way things are, and possess a willingness to see into the heart of things, rather than to merely look at appearances.\nWhen your inner life is clouded, your influence in the world is hidden in shadow. If you are fearful, you will be attacked; if you cloak mysteries with dogma, opportunities for insight will be lost. If you waver in upholding your principles, you will be tested. Yet, when you are firm and strong, the power of truth can break through even the most stubborn minds (including your own).\nIn a debate, the power to perceive the truth in another’s position is essential to winning the contest. Generally, it is possible to influence even the most difficult people, or improve the most difficult circumstance, through the power of shedding light on universal truths — for truth is something to which all beings naturally respond. Get in touch with that part of yourself that is in touch with this power. Cultivate this ability and become adept at using it to relate to those who might come to share a common purpose with you for the greater good.\n",

    meaning:
      "Nothing survives forever, not even rocks, or the most rigid of structures. Likewise, all of our obstacles will dissolve in time too. The erosion of that which has been solid is not a bad thing; in fact, it also means that something new is in the process of being created. One image for this is of ice floes, hardened in winter, dispersing in the warmth of spring; when the ice melts, a mighty river emerges. This image points to is a situation where small changes can produce big results over time.\nRigidity in the hearts of men breeds an egocentric separateness, but this can be transformed by a greater force, such as an uplifting ceremony or other communal activity. And the thawing of closed hearts always improves conditions for everyone.\nThe first thing to dissolve is any mental rigidity within yourself that might be feeding a sense of separation from others. Try to work closely with your friends and compatriots, concentrating on common activities that emanate from your integrity and goodwill. Some slightly dramatic action in support of the greater good can shift the energy, lift the spirits and lead toward new possibilities.\nSpiritual impulses, including a sense of justice, should be honored now, and acted upon. They provide a gentle impulse toward important and constructive change. Avoid righteous indignation or aggressive force of any kind, and any sense of disunity can be overcome. If you should have lingering business or partnerships that are inactive or not working, this reading suggests that you consider dissolving them.\n",

Like a newborn fawn, the opportunity for rapid development is there, but only through determination can the fawn rise to its feet and grow to full stature. Keep going despite difficulties and you will find the success that you desire. A key challenge at this time is to maintain clarity. Avoid lunging at solutions. Do not start a new project or relationship before thinking it through. Make yourself wait until a good course of action becomes clear. A careless step in the beginning can cause events to get out of control later. And be sure to enlist the advice of experienced people and wise supporters.\n",

Learn to choose the proper moments for action, thereby avoiding futile effort. Pay close attention to changes that signal a time to retreat.\nIn the realm of personal relations, discovering illusion can be painful and confusing.

    meaning:
      "Like an ancient forest — where the subtle play of light, texture and shadows results from a process measured in centuries and inches — things of lasting value develop gradually, at their own pace. The ability to learn from experience — one of humanity’s greatest treasures — implies constant yet very gradual progress. The combination of stillness within and determination without are the essence of this process. Good things can sprout quickly, but the truly delightful take much longer, like a beautiful tree on a mountainside.\nThe principle of gradual development also applies to relationships. For love, marriage, and other long-term partnerships, the best progress is slow but steady — slow enough to allow for the bonds to knit properly and steady enough to keep moving in the right direction. A firmly rooted tree has dignity. And, because its roots penetrate deep beneath the soil, it is not easily toppled. Steady development of your depths is what makes sustainable long-term progress possible.\nYou can’t expect to have everything all at once. Development must be free to take its course; events must neither be rushed nor manipulated, but allowed to unfold in their own natural time. In this way, you will achieve and enjoy long-lasting relationships, as well as success in the world.\n",

    title: "47: Oppression",
    meaning:
      "One image of oppression is a dried-up lake bed with scavenger crows stalking the shoreline. Hard times can shrivel our spirits, and give rise to a multitude of “crows” in the form of troublesome worries. Times of great loss or personal failure can break weaker people, but the strong of heart are able to bend with their fate. To endure hard times — or even benefit from them — you are called upon to tap the deepest stratum of your identity, which is stronger even than fate and essentially incorruptible by even the harshest realities. During hard times it is especially essential to tap that wellspring of human endurance — hope.\nIn one sense, there is no such thing as failure. There is only sweet-and-sour reality. Often more is learned from the sour than from the sweet. As for our failures, as hard as they may be to accept, they can open our eyes and reawaken a clarity of vision only known by those who have risked — and tasted — disappointment. This clarity and learning is the silver lining of dark clouds.\nWhen you are in the throes of difficult circumstances, it is important to be strong on the inside while remaining quietly cheerful on the outside. Avoid too much talking — except to your closest friends. Your words will have little effect on most others, since your influence will be at low ebb, and aimless talking costs you vital energy. A strong silence is the most skillful posture when facing the public during adversity; it shows that your inner core is strong enough to withstand the current troubles, and suggests that your recovery will be complete. At the same time, communicating openly with those you trust is also important, for in times of calamity, talking and feeling are part of the healing.\nFailure — the final taboo in modern society — is but one part of the inevitable cycle of life’s up and downs for those who dare to live fully and completely. Never to fail is to fail in the biggest way. By avoiding risk altogether, one will always fall far short of what might have been.\n",

Do not underestimate the power of this force. Like the wind blowing across the treetops, its presence is perceived through the effect it has on everything it touches.\nShallow wells rarely strike water, and shallow minds often come up empty. The ability to keep still and deeply observe strengthens resolve and attracts good fortune. Discern the difference between what is deep and what is shallow within yourself — and you will be able to distinguish between the two in the outer world as well.\nDuring a period between events, the practice of stillness with awareness is beneficial. By mindfully observing the true nature of things — by apprehending the rhythms and cycles, which guide all creation — we can discover natural laws that rule our lives. Examine yourself and your situation, not just with the thought of discovering truth, but also with the idea of focusing your personal power. This is the time to see and be seen.\n",

Naiveté unanchored by the ability to discern right from wrong, on the other hand, can bring misfortune.\nThe hallmark of innocence is a willingness to treat all creatures with compassion and respect.

      "Affection is an important part of intimate relationships, but it must be handled carefully in order to both be satisfying and support the self-respect of both parties. For instance, a married person’s lover would have the conflicted feelings of affection that are coupled with insecurity. Relationships that are based on personal attraction — especially those that are unconventional — require special attention and a cautious measure of tactful reserve.\nTo overcome challenges, and for a relationship to achieve longevity, you need to remain mindful of extreme feelings of attraction and the transitory nature of most relationships. It is an irony of life — that the happiest people are the ones who already have what they want and who want what they already have.\nIt is never easier to make disastrous mistakes than when you venture outside the bounds of propriety. If you assert yourself too much or try to make yourself indispensable, you will invite misfortune. If you are in doubt as to whether you should follow your heart or your head, allow for some time to pass, and perhaps the answer will become clear. Boldly asserting yourself right now could bring misfortune, so do not attempt to be overly creative or to attract much favorable attention. At the same time, allowing yourself to drift aimlessly can be a mistake. Find balance in a middle way.

There is still much activity left over from the light of day, and movements in the outer world are at their most dangerous. Even the smallest sound, the faintest glow of light, can attract unwanted attention now.\nWhen the darkness of stupidity reigns in human affairs, it is best to keep your brilliance “hidden under a bushel basket.” Let your thoughts and efforts be quiet, self-contained, and protected, as much as possible, from harmful influences.\nDon’t let yourself be swept along on the current of conventional wisdom when too many dangerous uncertainties exist. Try not to become too depressed or anxious; this period too shall pass. Just endure it for now and inwardly preserve your self-confidence, while outwardly remaining cooperative and flexible. The time to assert yourself will come. Avoid looking too far ahead if you have not yet achieved your goals — that will only stimulate feelings of regret or longing, which can eat away at inner strength.\nSo, be cautious and reserved. Control yourself. Do not needlessly stimulate forces of opposition. During dark, unsettled periods, it is best to step gingerly around sleeping dogs.\n",

As when a large boulder falls in the middle of your route, the best course of action is usually to go around it, rather than to try to move it out of the way. Temporary obstacles need to be seen for what they are — temporary — and not be allowed to take on too much significance.\nA positive aspect of even the most difficult stumbling block is that it can cause a person to turn inward, gaining greater depth of character and self-knowledge. While the ignorant bemoan their fate and seek to blame their problems on others, the wise always look to see if the cause of the problem is within themselves. Through introspection, obstacles can become a means for personal growth and self-discovery.\nWithout air resistance, no plane would ever fly.\nIf you are facing an interruption of your progress, do not be overly concerned. Challenges are a part of achieving every goal and every undertaking. Setbacks and reversals can affect morale, but keeping up your self-confidence in the face of obstacles is part of the successful solution to many, if not most, problems.

    title: "8: Holding Together",
    meaning:
      "Holding together produces success. High-level teamwork is achieved when the right players, on the right team, share a clear goal at the right time. A team forms its relationships in a delicate manner; chemistry is brewed in the vat of shared experience. Latecomers cannot share the same depth of union as earlier members. Wholehearted commitment is required for team success.\nAll successful teams have a shared vision and a good leader. If its leader can rise to the challenge, the team will prosper. In political and business affairs, just as in basketball, it is hard to win without a strong center.\nAccept the structure of the team if you wish to receive its benefits; otherwise, go off on your own. In holding together with others, cling to your own principles, but be willing to subordinate personal desires for the good of the group. If you would like to become a leader, remember that to become the center of influence, binding people together is a serious challenge and responsibility. Assess yourself carefully to see if you qualify for such a role. If not, it would be better that the group not be formed than for you to lead it without proper preparation.\n",

    title: "7: Organized Discipline",
    meaning:
      "Discipline is symbolized by water under the earth — a vital resource that is available but hidden, requiring effort to access. This potential can be drawn upon in times of need. Once it is accessed and applied, great things can be accomplished with organized discipline.\nThe most successful leader is not the one who triumphs on the battlefield, but the one able, through strength of discipline and inner power, to achieve conciliation without spilling blood. Likewise, in any large organization, key virtues are discipline and conscientiousness. The most effective team marches with a single purpose — a dedication to a lofty goal that is held dear by all. Even with an excess of external discipline, unpopular wars are seldom winnable.\nLet power be held in check by the willing acceptance of a common discipline, and the submission to a higher authority for the common good. When life is in balance, evil impulses are checked by human decency; parents die before their children; leaders lead and followers follow. If you hold or aspire to a position of leadership, remember that the true leader captures the hearts of the people, and articulates a clear vision that binds them together.\nIn the realm of government, a good relationship between army and state is critical. Only when the state is economically prosperous can the army be strong. Only when the army is disciplined can the state be protected from disruptive outside forces. For this balance to be preserved, government must be steady, and benevolent toward its own people. When balancing strong complementary forces like this, modesty and generosity in the leadership can be a magnetic force that keeps the relationships intact. Solidarity is essential for success.\n",
